# ðŸŽ­ ReactTheaterCounter_0803
After creating the [People-Counter-in-Theater_0710](https://github.com/michelle5434123/People-Counter-in-Theater_250710), with similar functionalities, I rebuilt this app with React called **TheaterCounter** that counts how many people enter a theater. It features an interactive counter UI with a clean layout, styled using CSS and enhanced with a background image.

## Features
- Live-updating counter using React state
- Accessible buttons with `aria-labels` for screen readers
- Footer section for branding
- Fully modular React component structure


## How It Works
- The app consists of two main components:
  - `App.jsx`: Handles state (`count`) and renders the counter interface
  - `Footer.jsx`: Renders the footer content
- `useState` from React is used to keep track of the number of people
- Button clicks call `add()` or `subtract()` to adjust the count


## Notes
- The background image file `ReactTheater.jpg` must be located in the root directory (or update the `background-image` path in `index.css`)
